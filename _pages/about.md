I am an economist who has been on faculty at SFU since 1999.

My research covers several areas of applied microeconometrics and empirical microeconomics. One stream is focused on developing
useful microeconometric tools, including simulation-based methods for measuring peer effects in discrete choice and methods for
sensitivity analysis of causal inferences made from linear regressions. Another ongoing stream with
my colleague Jane Friesen uses administrative data from British Columbia to investigate various issues in the economics of
education, including classroom peer effects, full-day Kindergarten, and language interventions. 

I teach applied econometrics, labo(u)r economics, and macroeconomics.
