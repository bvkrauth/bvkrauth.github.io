title: "English as a Second Dialect Policy and Achievement of Aboriginal Students in British Columbia"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/esd
excerpt: "Since the 1980s, the BC Ministry of Education has offered funding to support the language
development of students who speak non-standard dialects of English. In practice, the
students who are supported by this funding are almost exclusively Aboriginal, and English
as a Second Dialect (ESD) funding has grown to be an important source of supplemental
funding for Aboriginal students in many school districts. We exploit the staggered uptake
of ESD funding by school districts to identify its effect on academic achievement. We find
a sizable positive effect of ESD on grade seven reading achievement among Aboriginal students."
