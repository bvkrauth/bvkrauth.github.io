title: "Social interactions in small groups"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/small_groups
excerpt: "In the well-known ‘critical mass’ model of social interactions, aggregate
behaviour exhibits multiple equilibria if the influence of group behaviour on individual
behaviour exceeds some fairly high threshold. I demonstrate that this property depends
on an implicit assumption that the relevant social group is large (infinite). With small
(finite) social groups, the same model exhibits multiplicity whenever group behaviour
exerts any influence. The range of equilibrium group behaviour depends on the size of
the social group as well as its strength of influence. Brief applications on youth smoking
and retirement planning demonstrate the implications of these results for applied work."
