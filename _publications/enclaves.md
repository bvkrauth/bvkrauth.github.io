title: "Ethnic enclaves in the classroom"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/enclaves
excerpt: "We use data on elementary-school students to investigate how the home language and other
characteristics of a student's same-grade schoolmates influence that student's academic
achievement. We exploit the availability of multiple cohorts of data within each school
to control for endogenous selection by incorporating school fixed effects in the model. We
also exploit the longitudinal structure of the data to estimate value-added models of the
educational production function. We find that attending an “enclave” school provides a
slight net benefit to Chinese home-language students and a large net cost to Punjabi home
language students. The results are consistent with a simple peer effects mechanism in which
the academic achievement or behavior of peers is much more important than their home 
language."
