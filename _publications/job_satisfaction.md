title: "Job satisfaction and co‐worker pay in Canadian firms"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/job_satisfaction
excerpt: "One reason to be concerned about income inequality is the idea that people care about not only
their own absolute income but also their income relative to various reference groups (co‐workers,
friends, neighbours, relatives, etc.). We use Canadian linked employer–employee data to estimate
the casual effect of co‐worker pay on a worker's reported job and pay satisfaction. Since worker
satisfaction can affect the worker's productivity, organizational commitment, turnover, creativity
and innovation as well as the firm's productivity and profitability, this is an issue that
requires more attention and careful examination. In models that control for a rich set of workplace
characteristics, we find that co‐worker pay has a large positive and significant effect on both pay
and job satisfaction. In our preferred models with establishment‐level fixed effects, the effect of
co‐worker pay on pay satisfaction is half as large and the effect on job satisfaction completely
disappears, suggesting that part (all) of what previous studies attribute to the effect of co‐worker
pay on worker pay (job) satisfaction is driven by unobserved heterogeneity across firms or
establishments. Our results also suggest that the effect of co‐worker pay on worker satisfaction is
much stronger for workers who leave their job during the following year. Finally, we find that while
co‐worker pay has a positive effect on pay satisfaction among Canadian‐born whites, it has a negative
effect among immigrants and Canadian‐born visible minorities."
