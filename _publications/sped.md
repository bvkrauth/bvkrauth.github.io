excerpt: "We use data on students in grades 4–7 in the Canadian province of British Columbia to
investigate the effect of having disabled peers on value-added exam outcomes. Longitudinal
data for multiple cohorts of students are used together with school-by-grade-level fixed
effects to account for endogenous selection into schools. Our estimates suggest that
same-grade peers with learning and behavioral disabilities have an adverse effect on the
test score gains of nondisabled students in British Columbia. However, these effects are
statistically insignificant and are sufficiently small that they are unlikely to raise
concerns about the placement of this group of disabled students. The effect of peers with
other disabilities is also small and statistically insignificant but varies in sign."
