title: "A dynamic model of job networking and social influences on employment"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dynamic
excerpt: "This paper explores an economy in which personal connections facilitate job search. In
the model, a firm receives information on the productivity of those job applicants with
social ties to its current employees. In addition to providing a theory of networking,
the model endogenously generates two classic theories in economic sociology. First,
there is a highly non-linear relationship between average human capital in a group of
socially connected individuals and the group's employment rate. Small changes in group
composition may cause large changes in employment, as suggested in Wilson's ‘social isolation’
explanation for high unemployment rates among poor African-Americans. The model also supports
Granovetter's ‘strength of weak ties’ hypothesis, which holds that acquaintances are more
valuable job contacts than close friends."
