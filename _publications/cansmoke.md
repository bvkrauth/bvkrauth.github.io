title: "Peer effects and selection effects on smoking among Canadian youth"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/cansmoke
excerpt: "A number of studies have indicated that peer smoking is a highly influential factor in a young person's decision to 
 smoke. However, this finding is suspect, because the studies often fail to account for selection and simultaneity 
 bias. This paper develops an econometric model of youth smoking that incorporates both peer effects and selection
 effects. Identification is achieved by using the degree of selection on observables as a proxy for the degree of
 selection on unobservables. The results indicate that peers have some influence on a young person's decision to
 smoke, but that influence is much weaker than is suggested by reduced form models."
