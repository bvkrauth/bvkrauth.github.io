title: "Peers as treatments"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/peertreat
excerpt: "Models of social interactions are often estimated under the strong
assumption that an individual's choices are a direct function of the average
observed characteristics of his or her reference group. This paper interprets
social interactions in a less restrictive potential outcomes framework in which
interaction with a given peer or peer group is considered a treatment with
an unknown treatment effect. In this framework, conventional peer effect
regressions can be interpreted as characterizing treatment effect heterogeneity.
This framework is then used to clarify identification and interpretation of
commonly-used peer effect models and to suggest avenues for improving upon them."
