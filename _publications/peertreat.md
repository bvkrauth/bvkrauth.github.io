title: "Peers as treatments"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/peertreat
excerpt: "Social interaction effects are often estimated under the strong
assumption that an individual's choices depend directly on the
observed characteristics of their peer group. This paper considers
a less restrictive potential outcomes framework in which
interaction with a given peer or peer group is considered a treatment with
an unknown and variable treatment effect. In this framework, conventional
peer effect regressions can be interpreted as characterizing treatment effect
heterogeneity. This framework is then used to clarify identification and
interpretation of commonly-used peer effect models and to suggest avenues
for improving conventional empirical practice."
