title: "Peers as treatments: Understanding contextual peer effects"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/peertreat
excerpt: "This paper develops a general framework for interpreting linear regression estimates
of contextual peer effects under random peer assignment. Rather than imposing the
strong assumption that peers influence individual outcomes solely and directly through
specific observed characteristics, the model considers social interaction with a given
peer or group as a treatment with an unknown and variable treatment effect. In this
setting, a wide variety of conventional peer effect regressions are informative and can
be interpreted as measuring treatment effect heterogeneity along researcher-selected
dimensions of interest. These regressions can also be used to predict the consequences
of counterfactual peer group assignments. The relevance of the framework and results
to empirical research is illustrated using an application to measuring classroom peer
effects in Project STAR."
