title: "Peers as treatments"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/peertreat
excerpt: "This paper develops a general framework for interpreting linear regression estimates
of contextual peer effects under random or conditionally random peer assignment.
Rather than imposing the strong assumption that peers influence individual outcomes
solely and directly through specific observed characteristics, the model considers social
interaction with a given peer group as a treatment with an unknown and variable
treatment effect. In this setting, a wide variety of conventional peer effect regressions
are informative and can be interpreted as identifying treatment effect heterogeneity
along dimensions of interest to the researcher. The framework is then used to clarify the
limitations of common research designs and to suggest avenues for improving empirical
practice."
