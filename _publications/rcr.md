title: "Bounding a linear causal effect Using relative correlation restrictions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/rcr
excerpt: "This paper describes and implements a simple partial solution to the most common problem
in applied microeconometrics: estimating a linear causal effect with a potentially endogenous
explanatory variable and no suitable instrumental variables. Empirical researchers faced
with this situation can either assume away the endogeneity or accept that the effect of
interest is not identified. This paper describes a middle ground in which the researcher
assumes plausible but nontrivial restrictions on the correlation between the variable of
interest and relevant unobserved variables relative to the correlation between the variable
of interest and observed control variables. Given such relative correlation restrictions,
the researcher can then estimate informative bounds on the effect and assess the sensitivity
of conventional estimates to plausible deviations from exogeneity. Two empirical applications
demonstrate the potential usefulness of this method for both experimental and observational
data."
