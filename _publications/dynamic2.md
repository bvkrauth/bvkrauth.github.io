title: "A dynamic model of job networking and persistent inequality"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dynamic2
excerpt: "Although it rarely appears in economic models, job networking is a common feature of
labour market behaviour. This paper develops a model of the macroeconomic implications
of job networking for the behaviour of employment rates in an economy or community. I
find that the spillovers created by networking produce a highly nonlinear relationship
between community human capital and community employment rates. The model can be applied
to understand the emergence of a low-employment “underclass” community in which even
highly skilled or motivated individuals face severe employment difficulties."
