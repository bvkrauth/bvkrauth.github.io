This chapter outlines a new approach to measuring peer influence on the choice of a young
person to smoke cigarettes. The methodology is based on estimating an equilibrium discrete
choice model in which the relative benefit to smoking is increasing in the fraction of peers
who smoke. In contrast to much of the literature, this structural model allows for positive
correlation in observable and unobservable characteristics between peers. The structural
approach has been applied to estimating close friend peer effects in Canada, California,
and the USA in general. In all three settings, I find that close friend smoking is
substantially less influential than is generally found by previous studies.
