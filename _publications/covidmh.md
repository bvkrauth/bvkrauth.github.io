title: "COVID-19 and the Mental Health of Adolescents in British Columbia"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/covidmh
excerpt: "We use linked individual-level data on school enrollment,
physician services received, and prescription medications from September 2016
to March 2022 to measure the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
disruptions on the monthly frequency of mental health treatments received by
adolescents in British Columbia. The results suggest substantial increases for
non-Indigenous English home language girls in treatment for depression/anxiety,
ADHD, eating disorders and other mental health conditions. Non-English home
language girls also show increases in treatment for depression/anxiety and
Indigenous girls show increases in treatment for ADHD. In contrast, boys show no
change or even reductions in treatment for most mental health conditions. The
exception is conduct disorders, which increase among English home language boys.
Treatment for substance use disorders declines among English home language boys,
Indigenous boys and Indigenous girls. Effects vary somewhat by socioeconomic
status, but we find no evidence that they vary substantially by schooling mode."
