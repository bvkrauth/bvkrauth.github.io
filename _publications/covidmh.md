title: "COVID-19 and the Mental Health of Adolescents in British Columbia"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/covidmh
excerpt: "We use linked individual-level data on school enrollment, physician services
received, and prescription medications to measure the effect of the COVID-19
pandemic and associated disruptions on mental health treatment received by
adolescents in British Columbia. We also investigate whether these effects are
mediated by socioeconomic status and schooling mode. The results suggest
substantial increases for non-Indigenous English home language girls in
treatment for depression/anxiety, ADHD, eating disorders and other mental
health conditions. Indigenous and non-English home language girls also show
increases in treatment for depression/anxiety, and Indigenous girls show
increases in treatment for ADHD.  In contrast, boys show no change or even
reductions in treatment for most mental health conditions. These effects vary
somewhat by socioeconomic status, but we find no evidence that they vary
substantially by schooling mode."
