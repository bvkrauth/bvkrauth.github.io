title: "Simulation-based estimation of peer effects"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/smle
excerpt: "The influence of peer behavior on an individual's choices has received renewed interest
in recent years. However, accurate measures of this influence are difficult to obtain. Standard
reduced-form methods lead to upwardly biased estimates due to simultaneity, common shocks,
and nonrandom peer group selection. This paper describes a structural econometric model of
peer effects in binary choice, as well as a simulated maximum likelihood estimator for its
parameters. The model is nonparametrically identified under plausible restrictions, and can
place informative bounds on parameter values under much weaker restrictions. Monte Carlo
results indicate that this estimator performs better than a reduced form approach in a wide
variety of settings. A brief application to youth smoking demonstrates the method and suggests
that previous studies dramatically overstate peer influence."
