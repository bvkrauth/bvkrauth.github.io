title: "Peer and selection effects on youth smoking in California"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/calsmoke
excerpt: "Previous research has found that youth smoking choices are strongly influenced by peer
smoking. However, these studies often fail to account for simultaneity and nonrandom peer
selection. This article describes an equilibrium model of peer effects that incorporates
both of these features, and estimates its parameters using data on California
teenagers. Identification is aided by using the influence of observable variables on group
selection as a proxy for the influence of unobservables. I find that the effect of peer
smoking on the decision to smoke is much weaker than found in previous studies."
