title: "The effect of universal full-day Kindergarten on children’s behavior"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/fdk_behavior
excerpt: "We exploit the staggered rollout of universal full-day Kindergarten (FDK) to 
estimate its effects on children’s behavior and related family outcomes. Our 
research design identifies these effects by comparing across-cohort changes in
outcomes among early versus late adopting schools. We find little effect of FDK 
on child behavior or parents’ mental health, and an increase in hours worked by
parents who are employed part-time. These results hold across a range of child 
and family characteristics, with one exception. In families who do not speak English 
at home, FDK reduces child hyperactivity and peer relationship problems, improves 
parents’ mental health and increases employment and hours."
