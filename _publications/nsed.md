title: "Non-Standard English Dialects and the Effect of Supplementary Funding on Educational Achievement"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/nsed
excerpt: "British Columbia provides school districts with supplementary funding to support the language
development of students who speak a non-standard English dialect. Many of the students who
attract this supplement are Aboriginal. We describe this policy, and record a striking increase
in uptake of the funds on behalf of Aboriginal students over the last decade. We describe the
results of an evaluation study that measured the effects of supplementary funding on test score
gains between grades 4 and 7. The study found that the funding supplement substantially improved 
the reading scores of the average Aboriginal student."
