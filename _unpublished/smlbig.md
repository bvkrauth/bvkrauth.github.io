excerpt: "This paper derives a maximum likelihood estimator for an econometric model of
discrete choice with social interaction effects. Endogenous selection of
reference group is addressed within the econometric model through the incorporation
of a reduced form within-group correlation in both observed and unobserved
characteristics. The estimator requires only standard survey data which provides
information on a binary choice made by the respondent, a vector of the respondent’s
background characteristics, and the average choice made by a large reference group (for
example, school or census tract). Properties of the estimator are
demonstrated analytically and through Monte Carlo experiments."
