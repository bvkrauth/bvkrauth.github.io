excerpt: "This paper establishes a stylized fact about unemployment in U.S. urban 
neighborhoods: the relationship between average human capital and the unemployment rate in a given neighborhood
is highly nonlinear. Specifically, the predicted unemployment rate for a neighborhood
increases dramatically when the fraction of neighborhood residents with college degrees
falls below twenty percent. This pattern appears across all of the major U.S. cities. I then
use a simple model of neighborhood selection and neighborhood effects on employment to
evaluate 'epidemic' and 'sorting' explanations for this stylized fact."
