excerpt: "In 1976, black and white teenagers in the United States were about equally
likely to be cigarette smokers. By the early 1990's, the smoking rate of black
teenagers had dropped to one-third that of white teenagers. This paper analyzes
the role of peers, prices, and other factors in explaining this divergence in
behavior. I find that the dynamics of youth smoking can best be explained by
the combination of rising prices in the 1980's, a higher price elasticity for black
teenagers, and the amplifying effects of social interactions (peer effects). In the
process, I develop and implement several empirical tools for the analysis of the
equilibrium implications of social interactions. In particular, I develop a
procedure for determining whether peer influence is strong enough to produce multiple
equilibria, and a procedure for estimating the 'social multiplier' associated with
peer effects. I find that the multiple equilibria explanation is not empirically supported,
but that the social multiplier effect is large enough to account for roughly
half the difference in smoking rates."
